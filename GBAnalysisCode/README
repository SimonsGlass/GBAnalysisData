Softness code
=============

A machine learning approach to identifing particles
with a local structure of interest in a material.

Under initial development by A. J. Liu Group and at 
University of Pennsylvania and E. Kaxiras Group at 
Harvard University and collaborators.


Status
======

This version of the softness code was taken from a development branch by Tristan A. Sharp
during the 2016 analysis for the manuscript,
"Machine learning determination of atomic dynamics at grain boundaries"
Tristan A. Sharpa, Spencer L. Thomas, Ekin D. Cubuk, 
Samuel S. Schoenholz, David J. Srolovitz, and Andrea J. Liu
and submitted to PNAS in 2018.

Updated and cleaner code is available elsewhere!

Files in this version of the softness code stream:
identifyHopsv2.cpp
constructTrainingSetHopsv2_Ni.cpp
trainSVM.cpp
assignSoftnessField.cpp

Installation Notes
==================

Each file in the main directory X.cpp has a 
makefile_X and is compiled to binary xX with:
make -f makefile_X
The first line of each makefile should point to the 
directory of the source code.

An example run can be found in sampleinputs/ folder.  
From there, type:
../xX Inputs
and output will be generated in the sampledata 
subfolder.
